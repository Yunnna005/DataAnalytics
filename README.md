# Data Analytics Project using KDD Process

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate data analytics capabilities using the KDD process. The project involves analyzing a dataset using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and other data analysis tools.

## Requirements

- Analyze a dataset employing the KDD process
- Utilize Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, or other data analysis tools
- Review a minimum of four academic papers to ensure analysis is rooted in existing research
- Agree on the research topic and theme with the lecturer in advance

## KDD Process

The project will follow the KDD process, which consists of the following stages:

**Data Cleaning**: Removing noise and irrelevant data

**Data Integration**: Combining data from multiple sources

**Data Selection**: Selecting the data relevant for analysis

**Data Transformation**: Transforming the data into a suitable format or structure

**Data Mining**: Employing techniques to extract patterns

**Pattern Evaluation**: Identifying truly interesting patterns representing knowledge

**Knowledge Presentation**: Visualization, transformation, and removal of redundant patterns
