when my relationship ended i found a lot of the feelings i had as a teenager were coming back, then covid happened and by pure chance i saw a reaction on youtube to dynamite, within days i was deep diving everything bts but it was two songs in particular that changed my outlook.

seesaw, reading the translation was like looking in a mirror, i had tried to hang onto my failed relationship for too long when quite honestly he had already gone, to this day it is still one of my favourites as it reminds me of how strong i was to let go of what was holding me back.

and epithany, the reminder that i needed to try and love myself first, it is still a work in progress and probably always will be but i am definitely kinder to myself now than i have ever been in my life, i no longer think those awful nasty self loathing thoughts, and i am 100% happier for it.

when i think back at how i was pre bangtan and how i am now it is night and day in regards to my overall sense of happiness, and the biggest part of that has been them helping me to finally love myself instead of loath myself."
