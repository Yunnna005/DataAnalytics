From the deepest lows of breakups and toxicity to the euphoric moments of the first sight, they have explored everything that comes with love, whether romantic, platonic, metaphorical, you name it! I also have a special place in my heart for the social commentary songs where they talk about current trends and give their take on it through unique ways. Finally, any of their songs where they talk about their struggles and getting back up again and moving forward never fails to make me fall in love with them even more!

When my relationship ended I found a lot of the feelings I had as a teenager were coming back, then covid happened and by pure chance I saw a reaction on YouTube to Dynamite, within days I was deep diving everything BTS but it was two songs in particular that changed my outlook.

Seesaw, reading the translation was like looking in a mirror, I had tried to hang onto my failed relationship for too long when quite honestly he had already gone, to this day it is still one of my favourites as it reminds me of how strong I was to let go of what was holding me back.

And Epithany, the reminder that I needed to try and love myself first, it is still a work in progress and probably always will be but I am definitely kinder to myself now than I have ever been in my life, I no longer think those awful nasty self loathing thoughts, and I am 100% happier for it.

When I think back at how I was pre Bangtan and how I am now it is night and day in regards to my overall sense of happiness, and the biggest part of that has been them helping me to finally love myself instead of loath myself."

I think it's been really important for me to find a way of connecting with many different kinds of people, and keeping myself open to the world. ARMY is one of the most truly diverse groups of people I've encountered, and because of the prejudice many people have about labels like 'boyband' and 'kpop', those who are happy to march over the barriers tend to be particularly open-minded, unpretentious and sincere in a way I'd like to see more of in the world. At our best we can work together to have a really positive impact through charity work and social organising, as well as having interesting conversations, and a lot of fun.

Dance has also played a big part in my mental health and life. Their music don't just speak struggles and life journeys but the dance that is part of the Korean pop music is influential to my identity and hobbies. Which in turn helped me find some identity in myself.","Life, effort, pain, journey, etc...",No,Haven't participated actively in groups like that,No,"The dance part that I've shared in a previous section is something that one shouldn't overlook when it comes to mental health. For through dance one can really find, feel, and understand their identity and emotions. Do not limit that of course just to BTS music or dance choreographies. But BTS being a boy group that has dance involved; played a very big part to my introduction to the dance world. Which now is a very big part of my identity."

If I just wanna listen to music, it could be any song.",No,"Does being an ARMY count as enjoying their music or that I have to know every fact and like mega support them? I just enjoy listening to their music, not much else.

While listening to the blends of instruments, it takes my mind off current things; due to it being in a different language, I don't have to constantly worry about being judged for listening to ""explict"" music (even though BTS does have some).","Hip-hop, or Pop",Yes,"Having someone to nerd out with about music has been super helpful.

Moreover, before becoming an ARMY and getting to know the fandom, I always felt insecure while posting anything on social media.
