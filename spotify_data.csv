trainee
in many ways, this term defines my existence
but at the same time it is a term that i can never truly explain
a period of time, a state of transition
where i could neither belong anywhere
nor do anything
the biggest concerns i had living as a trainee
were the questions of friends and family
""when are you going to come out?""
""when are you going to debut?""
questions like these
i couldn't give them an answer
because i didn't know either
because such answers were unknowable
though i came here through a certain confidence
and belief in myself
what awaited me was a different kind of reality:
even now, after three years have passed
even as i occasionally gain the self-certainty to think things like
‚äúonce i debut, i will conquer the music industry‚äù
whenever i hear the criticisms of the producers and teachers
i am again overwhelmed by the realization that i am nothing
that i am as inconsequential as a speck of dust
it's as if though before me lies the bluest ocean
and if i turn to look back
a vast desert awaits me
in this hourglass-like mindset
in this mood
i spent my three years as a trainee
and now, my debut is finally drawing near
even after i debut
new oceans and new deserts will likely await me
i am not afraid
because what has made me who i am
are the oceans and deserts i have witnessed until this moment
i will never forget

allowed no time to breathe and tied me up while i was dreaming

lonely without family

i thought my worries will ease with the debut in front of my nose
i closed my eyes to the present that could not be altered
reality was different, even when my peers tried to help me
i walked the lightless tunnels on my own
i thought i was alone but i've learned that we are seven
no longer barefoot, wearing shoes called bangtan
we go on forward another step, newer than the last
towards the fourth spring, we'll greet in seoul, woah

my steps head to seoul
i, who started out just loving dance
is soon to stand on stage
until then i combat the many pains and scars and prepare myself
i nurture my notion to bend rather than to break
and run for 3 years
and ignite the stars in my heart
now see me anew
i carve ‚äòbangtan' into a blank page that means the whole world
i walk towards my brighter future
i put on a smile for the further days, ha ha

because of the excuse of reality

and part when they wither

is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?

we used to jump, wanting to be heroes
but now we've grown and time has passed
you're becoming an adult but i wanna rewind
to the times when the 10-year-old boy sang the theme song to his favorite superhero comic
i wanna go back so i close my eyes and scream
but nothing changes, reality is the same
no matter who tries to stop me
i will go on my way

2007 is when my life changed
it's been 7 years since i've sang
a killer of girls' hearts
but sometimes, i go back to those frustrating times
facing myself, who was like a white piece of paper
that encounter awakens a different me
now i'll go up on stage
and surprise everyone by jumping like jordan
ball!
go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air
you used to feel the joy of each jump, feeling like you have everything
letting myself go to the innocent dreams
my childhood days was impatient to be an adult
but each day was filled with joy
so can i be the one, just can i be the one
that i... stop

let's jump & down, we are here, we are bts
beat down, if you're ready, put your hands up high
it's different from what you've dreamed of when you were little but we have met, we're heroes, rappers in training
now jump to the stage, we are the new generation heroes
seven heroes-in-training, who were once immature, making a jump sound
instead of a trampoline, the place i need to jump on is the stage, crazily, up down
now don't just talk about it, it's time to spread my wings and go, let's get it started
spread your shoulders, rock your body, empty your head, let's go party

you were even born with sexy brain wrinkles
just in jeans, a white tee and converse high tops
that makes me wanna party on your body
at the end of of your long, shiny hair
your gentle hips sing
you're like a forest, shining inside the city
with that unrealistic body, you embrace my reality
and i want you to be really really real for me
sometimes like my mom, sometimes you're my energy
i'm an honest guy
i'm so nice on the outside that my enemies can't stop being honest
you're so different from the normal people outside
that's why you're called the ideal type
yeah, when i think of you, my heart grows cold
you're my winter ocean, i want to walk by you

you pass by my side
a sweet wind called you is blowing in my heart
even if you don't put on makeup
you'll put on your perfume called attraction
i never believed that there was a god
but now you make me believe because to me, you're a goddess
whether you're young or old, whether you have a hidden child
i don't care because i love you
if i'm with you, anywhere we go is a flower garden
instead of holding designer bags, you hold my hand
instead of jealousy and envy, you understand my nature
with you, i draw out my future
in between our couple shoes are a pair of baby sneakers

yes you're my only girl, you're the best
i want to know about your day, i want to become your sighs
yes you're my only girl, you're the best
you're someone who only exists in the movies

i think i'm attracted to you like a magnet, right now
your life, your heart, your face, your line
like a piece of a puzzle, you fit into my ideal type

you're a flower, i'm a bee, i'm only going toward you

if you keep spacing out, you'll be swept away
if you ain't no got the guts, trust
it'll all become yesterday anyway so what's the use?
i wanted to become happy and strong but why am i getting weaker?
where am i going? i'm going here and there but i always come back here
yeah, i'll probably flow somewhere, is there an end to this maze?
i have a long way to go but why am i running in place?
i scream out of frustration but the empty air echoes
i hope tomorrow will be different from today
i'm just wishing

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, don't ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest
even in the far future, never forget the you of right now
wherever you are right now, you're just taking a break
don't give up, you know
don't get too far away, tomorrow

tomorrow, keep walking, we're too young to stop
tomorrow, open the door, we see too much to shut the door
when the dark night passes, a bright morning will come
when tomorrow comes, the bright light will shine so don't worry
this isn't a stop but just a pause in your life for a break
turn up your thumbs and press play so everyone can see

follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, oh better
follow your dream like breaker
even if it breaks down, don't ever run backwards, never

because the dawn right before the sun rises is the darkest

with shoes worth a couple hundred, padded jacket worth a couple thousand
with a watch worth a couple hundred you feel good about yourself
education goes over the hill and student identity goes over the hill too
the class system of the 21st century is divided into two
those who have and those who haven't
those who wear the shoes and those who don't
those who have the clothes and those who don't
and those who try hard to get those things
what's going on? are you falling behind on the trend?
you whined and complained to get it, did i strike a nerve?
in your padded jacket, your greed fills it up
even after seeing your parents' curved spines, you're so coldhearted
you complain that all your friends have it and that they should buy it for you
(ayo baby) stop being so immature
you won't freeze just because you don't have that jacket
fill your head with good sense before it's too late

wow, it feels good, putting on your dirty clothes
you're something different, rockin, rollin, swaggin, swagger, wrong!

maybe i'm crossing the line for butting in other people's lives
why do you keep saying those empty words?
i'm saying i'll spend my own money that i received
you'll only be satisfied if i spend my money like you spend yours
please go take care of yourself
it's about your life, if you were me, i wouldn't say anything
yeah, my jacket is really expensive and not pretty at all
(but i say) i really want it so what do i do?
friends who are poorer than me have it too
(and i say) i have no choice but to buy it if i don't wanna be an outcast
people my age are all like this
yeah i dunno, yes i'm loco, is it no-no?
i know they ain't cheap but they got mojos
but i do what i gotta do, i don't break my parent's spines

everyone experienced it before
wearing expensive clothes and walking on the street, feeling good about yourself
everyone looks smaller than me like i'm gulliver

go back a few years
taking out the trampoline from the corner of the room and jump around in the air

a mini cultural asset that should be taken care of on a national level

her hair, body, waist, legs, even her other unspeakable parts
if anyone says he's not interested in them, i'd be surprised as a man
the tiniest gestures make me lose it
girl, your temptations make me sit at my computer every night. (looking at her profile)
for her, it's lady first
women are like cold ice mountains? let it go
a female that drives me crazy, provoking me every day
after fighting my hormones again today, i'll pop my pimple

(hello hello) (what!)
(hello hello) (what!)
tell me what you want right now
(hello hello) (what!)
(hello hello) (what!)
imma give it to you girl right now

you're not mine but you're the best
my body twists and turns in front of you

i want to approach you but you're seriously too beautiful

women are the best...

  only you, only you

why we got so much guys in this culture, tell me

it was a new world
i didn't think much of writing or poems
but it came to me suddenly like shim chung
i used to be a flightless bird but it opened my eyes
but people keep askin' baby
why you love that hiphop shit?
then i tell them, i don't have a reason
it's cause it's hip hop
nothing special, epik high

rakim, pete rock and cl smooth
they juss keep poppin
that's all i listened to
i was like an old lady
i had so much to say that it
wasn't enough with what other people told me
first, i forced it
layer after layer, calling it lyrics
and that was it! uh that was it
when i became me
on the white paper in between my textbooks
i put myself
and i erased it, emptied it
i was free on top of the beat
seven years ago or now
it's the same, this is the most me

boogaloo, king tut, old school rhythms
entrusting the beat with rhyme and my tongue
it shows its prominence, it's rap dance time
yeah ma role model
dynamic duo, verbal with epik high
i'm still inexperienced as i write my resume
breaking down my namelessness, flying on stage
they helped me get up when i didn't know anything
the artist, ring that rang through my heart
expressing it with their bodies, biggie, 2pac, nas
i found out more about myself
hope hope world
before i made my own world, cole world
ever since he shone on friday nights
i got inspiration and wrote my songs
mac miller, kanye, kendrick
their music hits my ears
the best musicians that affixed
my life's borders that went crazy every day
endless diction, all right, my instincts choose
whatever rap it is, whatever dance it is
my response is sensual
now my life melts with hip hop

hip hop has found me
just like a child looks for his mother
it came into my life naturally
i was just an elementary student back then
i set up my dream then
i want a rapstar, as others
i hated living the same, the prematurity of a little kid
even if people hold me down and warn me
hip hop persists in me
and completely turns me inside out
the young me used to write
my 16 bars on the corner of my textbooks
thanks to that, i threw away my secure life
and went to a studio in namsan-dong, daegu
all night, i sharpened my blunt pen tip
at the end of my efforts
instead of having a language marks for school
i filled up my rhymes
which made my dreams come true
everyone asks me, what is hip hop?
then i confidently answer, my everything
as a result, my life has buried itself into music
if loving this culture is a sin
i'll die over a hundred times

i'll be down for your rap
i'll be down for your rhythm

the heat between me and you won't cool down
now i look back at the film with you
too early to do anything by thinking of you
you took away my stars at night, my sun at day
only leaving me with the darkness of a single cold cloud
if there are hellos, then there's bound to be goodbyes? never ever

the racing cars, the squirming umbrellas all over the place
it's cloudy and the air is clear
(the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle)
with a light gray background, why am i standing here?
i don't know if i have a lot of thoughts or no thoughts at all
i wake up when it's just about to get bright outside
i brush back my hair when my exhausted hands
the memopad with the song i couldn't complete last night
i'll finish it today as i shut my eyes and let out a sigh
what excuse can i give? i try to make something up
it's unfinished anyway so i'll just make anything up
then i turned my eyes to the window and everything looks gray
gray city, gray buildings, gray roads, gray rain
everything in this world is slow
my younger sibling who woke up keeps talking back
i keep opening and closing the innocent refrigerator
with the unknown empty feeling that washes over me
i think that i should just go outside
without even an umbrella
i can clearly hear the rain hitting the earth
i smile, it's the best background music
like a crazy guy, i start to hum
i wonder what time it is
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still can't fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
it's a rainy night, the rain knocks on my window, it hits my heart
with my sore shoulders, i look at my phone and see a text, ‚äúhow are you these days?‚äù
my friend's text gets my emotions going
as i inhale the scent of the wet rain, i stretch and go to the bathroom
then i greet myself, half asleep in the mirror
i have no one to meet but i take a longer shower than usual
rain is still falling outside the house
i have no where to go but i take my umbrella
and walk outside without a plan
as if the rain wants its existence to be known, my shoes get dirty
am i someone who engraved my existence to you like the rain?
if not, am i just someone who came and went like a rain shower?
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still can't fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
i get up and when i feel sore, i look out the window
as if it knows how my body feels, the rain is falling
as i look at the raindrops welling up in the window, i felt it
the tears that were flowing down my heart
with that strange feeling, i look outside and it looks like my situation
the rain that falls like a melody makes everything seem andante
i get ready and leave, opening the umbrella that was as wrinkled as my face
as i walk, the moment i heard the rain
i wondered who this rain was falling for
a sound that hits against the lonely gray cement
come slow down
the thick color of a rainy day in seoul
i still can't fall asleep as i fade away
the rain stops and the reflection in the puddle
i see myself looking more miserable today
even when this rain stops, when the clouds go away
i stand here, just the same
without saying anything, looking at the world
there, a not so beautiful me is looking at myself

who the man told you crazy?
who the fella told you crazy?
i'm better than ya lazy
rather than those who do hip-hop through the keyboard
i live a hundred times harder
they look at rap easily genre, too many generals
uncertain, ambiguous all of them have some manners
those who can't even continue on one verse
because they try to discuss rap or music
that's why here they all still rap the same way like this
only three or two words, they're all critical patients
mother-father aphasic patient all just con artist
back yourself and look at the mirror
if you want to be a piece, make it an original
just try something suckas the sincerity in this is zero

on this scene that's about illegal things
this songs legality will make everyone fall into a trap
hang hang over bang
explode and come out swag
whenever i go, i drive straight
and wherever i go, it's there the losers of hip-hop
they're at a different proportion of levels to be cussing at me
busy by my talking has come, all unnies call me beep beep
someone's cussing at me
tell them to look at their own situation and then come to me
i don't have anything to be jealous of about others

i roll, roll around, act like a beagle, then i start to burn up
strength right now right now

the scenery of this city won’t change

no matter how serious i become, as i become serious

the gear/cog wheel rewinds and rushes

but, ever never give up the life is a big seesaw

there are up and downs, even in the natural world

your hands are going to be chained one day

there is glory sometimes, but it also gets closed

can you feel this life? if so, don’t give up

let’s aim for the shining tomorrow for our dreams

even if there are times when you feel discouraged, it’s not meaningless

even if you’re in the last place now, if you have a dream you’re not

so never give up, don’t think too much about it

just by looking at it you won’t archive the big show

with your heart, little by little, along with your dream, the upcoming future’s success

until that time don’t stop and let it go again!

no matter when, yes!

no matter what happens

if you look up

uh, the shining stars

so, we’ll be alright

be alright

be alright

just like that shining star

light up as if you’re going to disappear

all night long

the overlapping moon light

the throbbing good night

all night long

all night long

the overlapping moon light

the throbbing good night

all night long

hold up! the surges to give up

that life is more valuable than you think

let’s start with small steps

even so, why is the thorny road wrong? huh

there are unpleasant things sometimes

but if we’re together, it’s like a harmony surrounds us

our warm hands together, hugging our

chest and hopes, all the way to our hearts

understanding each other that’s right we’ll change to a super positive mind

so don’t worry (no wait)

life’s a game time to enjoy (go play)

we ride (go way) we right (okay)

escaping my future (go straight)

now, the volition bullets that hit my heart

are oriented to the world powpow! like a shot gun!

no matter when, yes!

no matter what happens

if you look up

uh, the shining stars

so, we’ll be alright

be alright

be alright

just like that shining star

light up as if you’re going to disappear

all night long

the overlapping moon light

the throbbing good night

all night long

we wanna get money, we wanna get the fame

we wanna get everything, but we still feel the same

where is the happiness headed?

it unexpectedly doesn’t go anywhere

a day ends in your mind, inside the building

that’s the only thing money can’t buy

the dreams are free size, aim to the vast skies

in your chest yes! the big milky way on the flow!

no matter when, yes!

no matter what happens

if you look up

uh, the shining stars

so, we’ll be alright

be alright

be alright

let’s just meet soon again
the awkwardness surrounds us
you were different before, in order to cover up
for your (former) coolness, i casually talk to make the conversation bloom
i remember the past again
our relationship becomes “ex”
between us oh no! becomes “x”
when did a wall form between us? two people who pass by without noticing each other
ey

at that place, again with you
at that place, if we can meet
at that place, i’ll be waiting
i want you to come girl

don’t know, looking like you don’t know
a girl who seems fun
i’m still crazy about you, you’re still cute
you’re still dazzling girl
don’t know, looking like you don’t know
a girl who seems fun
a girl who shines

today too memories pass through the lan cable
the memories draw me back, your hair from behind
i’m always looking at the blue screen, i start to hate it
every time i feel like clicking the “like” button i try calling you
hello?
i wish that you remember me, if you could maybe…
it’s ok, i say that i want to meet you soon
tell me if you want to meet me or not
it’s simple, i want to feel relieved so i’m over-optimistic
if we can meet i want it to feel like a goukon
your words break the silence
“i got a boyfriend”, that place starts freezing
of course you changed
even that expression of yours is different
the burning love flows like water
the spring is far, the winter days flow again…

at that place, again with you

you’re still dazzling girl
don’t know, looking like you don’t know
a girl who seems fun

how were you lately?
i peeked and the “like” shined
you cutie
even being happy when you’re alone now…
hey remember now
from that time the time difference has increased
even if i try repeating it the theory won’t change
even so i still click the “like” button…

i think the best would be if everything ends
at that time, when i almost went to the wrong path
i heard my parents voices saying ""wake up already!""
aight mom, i'll stand up now
my fam, my friends and also my fans
for you who are like a dream, more than my own dream
i won't sleep anymore
i have to make my face and body keep going to work
my pen is a sword, my whole body is a pistol
and all my haters, if you tried living you'll also feel tired
but i gotta kill ya'll for the sake of living myself i gotta beat ya'll
lately, i understand my parеnt's feelings
these feelings seem like thеy're going to overflow in my mind
no matter how tired or sleepy i am

i know, i'm tired
it's not someone's fault, i'm doing it to myself
even the music that i like turn into a battlefield
shit! there's no other way, but to do it crazily!
i'll keep going forward on my destiny
i start a bit later than everyone else
a day, a feeling of hoping to play is postponed
today is crucial for my dream
i don't care about the things ahead
22 years old, nothing more
i feel the difference from my surroundings, it's like an hypnosis
i sleep like i was drunk, but i wake up
i change into my tired face, today's life
i chase the reality but i'm a dream chaser
i might be lethargic, so if i wear my costume, i turn again
on the stage, the moment when i'm on it i wake up
that's the meaning of my life, with this step up!

going downwards with the body and mind

we get showered by everyone's cheers, i'm enchanted!

so exciting if no one can't stop my shoot

i keep on living on the day that i feel like i understand, but i don't

i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other people's things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
let's not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
let's not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

let's move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let's move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that we're about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe that's why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
there's more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now let's take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after you're done, let's get a bowl of black bean noodles, that's right

let's move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let's move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my mom's heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so i'm gonna move again
i'm gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

let's move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to

now to a higher place

makes them so gravely lonely that they quietly shut their mouths

breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends

  hyung, i thought about it but don't you think that you've gone over the line a little?
  what is? what? what?
  don't you think you're coming a little too late these days?
  wow, what are you saying?
  i personally think that is completely understandable considering he's the leader
  lol
  am i not human?
  why are you being like this to me?
  who do you think you are?
  ugh, i'm so tired
  namjoon-hyung is leader-hyung, he gets privileges
  exactly, the leader suffers so much
  leader-hyung suffering, (mumble mumble)
  i'm sorry, i think i'm the wrong
  i'm sorry we're (v & jimin) are same age friend as well, ugh
  yeah, things are hard for me these days, ah my shoulders hurt
  we've finished now
  is your shoulder right?
  ah, i don't know
  wow, i almost feel asleep while washing up
  i don't know why but i feel like that is possible
  yeah, you did that the other time
  hey, but kids
  just like sitting on the ground or something
  when i saw before v looked like he was going to die maybe that's why he wasn't singing?
  but i surprisingly get a lot of motivation support from v-hyung
  quit it
  lol
  ah, seriously stop being like that
  yeah you looked like you were having a rough time
  ah i said stop it
  you must have had such a hard time
  ah! seriously!
  not doing the dance properly as well
   yeah
  but seriously today ''i need u'' was so great
  dope! dope! it was awesome!
  oh yeah dope! dope was the best
  okay, yeah, they're all great but, don't you think ""danger"" was a killer?
  danger
  okay, but with ''i need u'', i can't even imagine how would it have been like if the ''i need u girl'' bit wasn't in it
everyone sings along to it, ''i need u girl'' you know that bit
  suga-hyung wasn't even like rapping at the beginning
  yeah, yeah, suga wasn't
  suga-hyung wasn't rapping at all
  he was just like holding the microphone
  suga-hyung was just doing stuff like this
  hey hey hey, i'll just say one thing
  he's really just half-assing it
  please just piss off
  lol
  if you don't even want to do that
  you just wanted to say that didn't you?
  that means that your voice didn't come out in ''i need u''
  it came out well, that's for sure
  i felt good, though, to be honest when suga-hyung didn't rap but everyone sang along anyway
  okay but imagine this
  there were so many people there as well and it just felt so good
  we just opened our eyes but we're practicing for ''no more dream'' in the training room, how would you feel?
  no, no, i'm not going back
  no them, i'm just to go down a different path
  yep okay, you do down another road
  that's it, you are doing ''no more dream'' right now only eating chicken breast
  no no no no, i can't
  you are with that cold argilla chicken breast
  seriously the manager-hyung. what about the scene where you secretly tried to have salt with the chicken breast and got
caught?
  oh no, no no no no
  my perm hair
  like seriously, this is just like all a dream and ''i need u''.  ''i need u '' is all a dream
  but seriously
  but sometimes it does seem like a dream
  but it's not just that
  don't say things like that!
  back in the day i used to eat world cone but now i'm doing world tours
  ah fainting, ugh okay
  what is that
  your sense of humor had significantly dropped
  these things get cut out immediately
  with one song
  okay but seriously, this could all be a dream, like to be honest there were lots of artists that did well in korea
  that's true
  i always think you should do well with one song first then go further but i'm a little bit anxious because it's not like our title song has come out yet or anything
  that's true
  ah this kid has a talent in bringing down the mood
  suddenly... it's almost like the titanic
  yep
  right before it sinks
  it's been overthrown
  ah, yoongi-hyung just happens to say something like this, really bursts the bubble
  i know right
  ""the title hasn't even come out yet''
  i know right, ''the title songs hasn't even... ''
  no wait! okay, so the title just has to come out well, right?
  yeah
  yeah then just like make it well, huh? release it and boom it will be a hit again. so easy amirite?
  lol
  hey you should just go to bed
  yeah, you suit being asleep better
  you usually don't say anything
  at this point i want to ask hobi, say something about your expectations for our music this time round
  hobi, what do you think?
  i think we'll do well
  lol
  noo
  lol shut up shut up you guys are so loud
  yeah we're not going to do well
  but kids, our youth is bright
  oh ya
  when we go to korea! bang-pd-nim will have prepared incredible tracks for us
and us? we just have to add our talent on the top of it!
  why are you being like this?
  we can say no no to our worries
  ah but worries

i remember how we came here three years ago
when you and i used to fight all the time
the wallpaper, bathroom and veranda were all blue
back then i thought this was a big place
but my ambition grew too big
that big house became too small now
when the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house
seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot
good things were always other people's things
we were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries
seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards
let's not forget those things but put them away
this place smells like us
let's not forget this scent, wherever we are
we cried a lot and laughed a lot but it was so beautiful
nonhyeon-dong, 3rd floor, thank you

let's move
goodbye to this place, that we grew attached to
let's move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

three years felt so short but so long
a lot of things happened, there were many memories
i remember now that we're about to leave
traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards
as much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter
fight right here, hitting each other sometimes
maybe that's why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too
even the dust will be cleared now
there's more stuff than the beginning, i have more than when i started too
now let's take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream
a new start, a new beginning
excited to see how it will become
move the boxes, hold your place, wipe the dust
after you're done, let's get a bowl of black bean noodles, that's right

let's move
now to a higher place
while taking the last box out of the empty room
i looked back for a moment
times we cried and laughed
goodbye now

ever since i was born
i counted the days for my first move
i remember, why i had to move
the machine in my mom's heart and the big scar
in winter of 2010 at daegu
the childish me used to measure the size of the world
the reason why we moved into a business
was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow money
so moving left many things with me
whether i liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life
my life was about paying rent, i know
i lived with my pride put into the down payment
so i'm gonna move again
i'm gonna have a dream, a level higher than being an idol
when will i stop having to move again?
i hope it comes quickly

lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesn't have a response
reaches tomorrow

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
an endless signal will reach someday
everywhere, even to the other side of the earth

no more, no more baby
no more, no more
even the blind whales will be able to see me
today i sing again

the world will never know
how sad i am
my hurt is water and oil that can't mix
so only above the surface of the water do i
breathe, and the interest (towards me) ends
a child in the lonely ocean
i want to make it known too
my value, everyday
i become sick with worry, the sticker always beneath my ear
never end‚ä¶ why is there no end and always hell?
as time goes by, it's a neverland in a cold abyss!
but i always think, now
even if i sleep a shrimp's sleep, my dreams are like that of a whale's
the upcoming big praise will make me dance everyday
like me, ye i'm swimmin'

i go towards my future
that blue beach and
believe in my hertz
hey oh, oh hey oh yeah

lonely lonely lonely whale
sing alone like this!
will i ever shine so brightly like a remote island?
lonely lonely lonely whale
like this, try calling once again
until this song that doesn't have a response
reaches tomorrow

mom said the sea is blue
she said to let out your voice as far as you can
but what to i do? it's so dark here and there are only different whales speaking entirely different words!
i just can't hold it, ma! i want to say i love you
alone, i look back at this music sheet that's like a rotating song
this ocean is too deep
still, i'm lucky
(no one besides me knows of these tears.)

how did i do today?
did everyone enjoy?
but i’m okay with that, 
for me to be able to make people feel joy like this
it makes me feel lingering effects of happiness
now, on this empty stage

on this empty stage
the loneliness visits me
i get mixed feelings
i repress it all and pray
and i simply get over it
i thought i was used to that
but i can’t hide this feeling
by the time things have cooled down
i leave this stage again…

i put my worries behind me
they say there is no such thing as perfection
i put down my burdens
because this applause won’t last forever
but even then, i want to stay with it
i want to keep those voices with me
even if it won’t last forever, i’ll continue to sing
i won’t change, i’ll be the same
i’ll forever be young

in the corner of my childhood house
a brown piano settled on one side

way taller than my height
the brown piano that guided me
i looked up to you, i yearned for you
when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didn't know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didn't know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didn't know that would be the last
you say don't leave like this

don't worry even if i leave
you'll do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
don't ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing
after the dawn, two of us
we welcomed the morning together
don't let go of my hand forever
i won't let go of you again either

i remember back then
we burned up the last of my teen's
yes the days when we couldn't see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really can't do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair
even when i pushed you away
even when i resented meeting you
you were firmly by my side
you didn't have to say anything
so don't ever let go of my hand
i won't let you go ever again either

you will be there to watch over it all

when i touched you with my small finger

i feel so nice mom i feel so nice
i played the piano wherever my hands took me
i didn't know your significance back then
back then i was content with just looking at you

i remember back during my elementary school days
when my height
became taller than yours
i neglected you when i once yearned for you so
on top of the white jade-like keyboard
dust is piling on
your image that has been neglected
even then i didn't know
your significance
no matter where i am
you always defended that spot
but i didn't know that would be the last
you say don't leave like this

don't worry even if i leave
you'll do well on your own
i remember when i first met you
before i knew it you grew up
though we are putting an end to our relationship
don't ever feel sorry to me
i will get to meet you again no matter what form
greet me happily then

i remember back then when i met you that
i had completely forgotten, when i was around 14
the awkwardness was only for a moment, i touched you again
even though i was gone for a long time
without repulsion
you accepted me
without you i am nothing

we welcomed the morning together

i won't let go of you again either

yes the days when we couldn't see an inch in front of us
we laughed, we cried
those days with you, those moments are now in memories
i said, grasping my crushed shoulder
i really can't do any more
every time i wanted to give up
by my side you said
bastard you can really do it
yeah, yeah i remember back then
when i was fed up and lost
back then when i fell into a pit of despair

even when i resented meeting you

jin: thatôøωs right
jimin: we talked about it at jamsil bridge and at the cafôøω with this hyung. he always called me up and always talked to me.
jin: he called the members and talked to the members one by one often
rm: cafôøω office. (laughter)

jungkook: we both fell asleep in the same way (laughter)
jin: j-hope and i only played in chinese class (laughter)
j-hope: that was a really long time ago
rm: i didnôøωt think weôøωll get to debut, even after the year we debuted
suga: i... i even got injured at that time, i didnôøωt think iôøωd debut
rm: to be honest, we are the only ones that received an award at the show as a k-pop group
j-hope: true
v: true

rm: iôøωm not saying we should boast, but to be honest it is a huge success. thatôøωs what i think. but because of that, i keep wondering - to what point, how far we need to go up. like we go really far up. for example, the video in front of us, wonôøωt it be replayed forever? like in 10 years, we'll go on reality shows and theyôøωll play that video and ask how we felt over and over again. after experiencing that, it makes me nervous honestly. it makes me wonder how far we might fall down.
j-hope: ow... yeah
suga: me too, me too. i relate so much because the hardest thing for me is that going up is going up. we worked hard to come up to where we are.
v: i donôøωt like that
suga: but compared to that, wonôøωt falling down happen so quickly? i worry about that a lot.
rm: hmm, thatôøωs what iôøωm saying
jin: itôøωs like when you meet someone for the first time and you have that kind of excitement - feelings of nervousness and worry of what this person is going to be like. isnôøωt it similar?
rm: first meeting kind of feeling?
jin: yeah, first meeting
j-hope: what are you saying suddenly? (laughs)
jungkook: yeah, hyung i think you reallyôøω
jin: did i go too far?
j-hope: we have to settle this today (jimin laughs)
jin: ah, iôøωm nervous for today (chattering)
j-hope: we have to play a game today
jungkook: i think i know what youôøωre talking about
jin: yeah so if you understand, quickly make the mood or something yeah? (laughter)
jungkook: sing a song!
jin: yeah

v: (sings) ôøωthey tell me to comeôøω (sings a typical traineeôøωs christmas) (laughter and chattering)
suga: i remember when jungkook sang seôøωorita and his voice cracked!
jimin: ahh yeah seôøωorita... back then, i couldnôøωt even get lessons
j-hope: ahh thatôøωs right
jimin: i couldnôøωt even get lessons, so i just watched
jin: jimin joined really late
jimin: somewhat, a little bit i... (laughs)
v: jimin thenôøω
jimin: stop it, i know what youôøωre going to say
v: when jimin couldnôøωt get lessons, he came to one of my lessons
jimin: what?
v: when i was having lessons
jimin: vocal?
v: yeah
jungkook: observer, observer
v: he was just observing that time and i thought i would show him a cool side of myself. all i did was ôøωdoomba, doomba, doombaôøω (laughter)
jimin: seriously, all he did was that for hours ôøωdoom, doom, doomôøω (jin laughs) he did that the whole time and ended
v: ahh, i wanted to show him how cool i was
rm: that kind of feeling in those chinese martial art films, they make you clean for 3 years
jin: ah thatôøωs right, thatôøωs right... you went to the kitchen and washed the dishes for 3 years
rm: thatôøωs right (jimin laughs)
jungkook: thatôøωs why jimin-hyungsôøω first practice was ôøωwhy do you call me?ôøω
jin and jimin: (sings) ôøωwhy do you call me, why do you call me, tee de de deôøω

rm: at that time, that was then and now is now. i think itôøωs like our collective idea of an idol. about how we want to live, what we show. we keep throwing out social issue messages. like even now, our album title is ôøωlove yourselfôøω too. we donôøωt make meaningless songs, but doing this seems like weôøωre acting too, as weôøωre living our life.
jimin: yeah, so i think people might not knowôøω
j-hope: we want to show a good image to people (chattering)
jin: weôøωve always
jimin: they donôøωt understand why we have to live like this - thereôøωs no other way
suga: weôøωve always?
jin: we have always shown ourselves as good people (j-hope laughs)
jimin: yeah, i mean we want to show our good image too
jin: thatôøωs right
suga: this is, this is difficult. i mean it isnôøωt fake for sure
jimin: right
suga: if you think about it, weôøωre just people that are presented after being wrapped up nicely

of what you gave to me, the courage to carry on

we’ve met, defying time
so, how do we do? can we realise it?
this uncertain love

the world is faster than i thought
how we gonna change it?
we don’t know yet
but surely…

(eh) love, within our hearts, uh yeah
(eh) slowly, it starts to resonate

i want to hold you tight once more before you disappear
ah, crystals soaring up high so boundlessly
hey, i don't need anything else; i just want to feel you a little while longer
can i touch your heart?
i want to touch it, and yet it slips through my fingers
oh, someday… someday…

your small smile is painful somehow
how can i be closer uh…
why can’t i find an answer to this feeling

how i am gonna find it?
how?
oh, let me know

always taking such ambiguous shapes, crystal snow
i can’t take another story that comes to nothing
eh, i would change it with my own hands

(eh) surely, i could swear to you, but still…

i want to protect you once more before it turns into tears
crystals getting further away the more i wish for them
even 100 years from now, i want my next step to be with you
can i be your one?
the snowy night sky without a single star
oh, someday… someday…

the two of us are already far apart
although we’re supposed to be one
now, we can't choose over things
such as the paint that colours us
not even the black breath
not even the deep white fog of you
i feel, i feel, i feel, i feel
oh, crystal snow, crystal snow
in the midst of this pure whiteness
even if you pass through me and turn into water, you still flow in my heart
(you still play on in my heart)
you’re reflected on everything that shines
i gaze at you as you glow
i will wait for you, no matter where
i want to see you, even if it’s a lie, please hold this hand

the melody that's melted by the heat of our love
this genuine warmth, please last forever

i want to hold you tight once more before you disappear
crystals soaring up high to make my wish come true
hey, though my words may be lacking, i will tell you as it is
can i touch your heart?
i want you to believe in me, i will come pick you up
someday… someday…

it’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(let me see your smile, oh baby, eh)
it’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(let me feel your love, yes, to the end of time, whoo)

makes me miss you more

i miss you, but i don’t have time
time simply passes by
and amidst its flow, i blame myself, and again

it's as if it were winter; as if there's a blizzard even in the summer
a train with my heart on board, already running through the snow
i'd rather just grab your hand and run away to the other side of the earth with you

i'd be able to reach you quickly, but...

until the flowers bloom

you changed?
if not, then i changed
we will endure this passing of time
and i guess change yet again
it must be like that for everyone, right?

that’s right, now that you’re away
my feelings that have never wavered
they won't change, but still, let's break up now
because that’ll be less painful

you disappear, cold, like this sighed breath i let go, this sighed breath i let go

and lingering regret crawls over my face
to me, you were once my dear
but now you're merely a bitter beer
my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie
the price that i had to pay came to me
if someone said they would turn back the time for me
would i have been able to be a bit more honest?
the bare face that only i know
the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before
with that smile with which you used look at me
stop saying things like forever, forever
after all, the end originally exists
if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that
words that are too correct or too much consolation.. i don't wanna listen to that
i was just so scared
because it seemed like perhaps i had never loved you at all
although it was late, that you were true
that only you loved me

so that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left

that's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
this is the ending you were wishing for
so go on and kill me without hesitating

my heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
becomes empty even with the passing breeze
at the end of my play where breakup was a lie

would i have been able to be a bit more honest?

the ugly and pathetic old friends within me
would you still be able to love me again like before

if there's a start, i don't wanna listen to that

that only you loved me

as i keep tossing and turning ey
maybe i fell in order to take the place of those countless stars

i should love myself (oh)
i'll answer with my breath, my path

the me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
(i'm learning how to love myself)
with no exceptions, it's all me

maybe there's no answer
maybe this isn't the answer either
it's just that loving myself
doesn't require anyone else's permission
i'm looking for myself again
but i don't wanna die anymore
me, who used to be sad
me, who used to be hurt
it'll make me more beautiful

yes, i have that beauty
knowing that is going
on the path to loving myself
it's what i need the most
i'm walking for myself
it's an action needed for me
my attitude towards myself
that's the happiness i need for me

with a voice a little more solid

now i'll spread wide a map called you

look at me, why can't you recognize me?
i don't want to hear other people's noises
your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
let's go back to that time

baby i know
i can make it better
i can hold you tighter
all those roads
are pointing to you

everything was useless
anything other than you
just touch me like that time

it's you who gifted me the morning

you are still beautiful
just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
the reason i survived in hell
it's for you, it was not for me
if you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
i'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
so hurry and grab me quickly

""respect""‚åübut these days‚åüi'm confused of its meaning
they say it's said when someone keeps doing something (why?)
i'm not really sure either, brother, do ya know?
it's obviously superior than love
probably a concept that exists at the most superior rank
out of all the superiors
isn't that called respect, huh? (what i'm sayin')
""re-spect"" means as it sounds, to literally look again and again
look again and again and you'll see faults
but you still want to keep looking, despite of that
you'll need that perfect belief towards someone (ayy, ayy)
so i can't get myself to easily say
the weight and thickness of it is vague
i hope someday i can confidently say it
and mean it when i do, to you and to me, huh

please don't say respect easily, yeah
because even i am not sure, yeah
sometimes i'm scared of myself

i don't know, that's why i'm asking, you rascal (oh, i see)
what even is ""respect""?
why is everyone saying it
honestly i can't understand
admiring someone
was it something really that easy?
i still can't understand it
to be honest, there's no need for admiration
when there's not even respect

i shine into your heart
i’m your light i’m your light
no matter how far apart we might be
i will send it to you

i didn’t think there was
such a thing as a sleepless night
but it seems like it’s not a lie
and again, i get stronger
what is love?
if that is where the answer lies
i want to know it right away
i’m breaking down, i can see the light through all of this
no matter how dark the night might be, morning will come
we’ll overcome it, even the future
we won’t stop now
wouldn’t you rather decide for yourself what value happiness holds for you?
and today, again, you’ll grow up

but there are also times you show your weakness
it’s fine to be just who you are
don’t lie to yourself anymore
everything connects through sound, woah

when i close my eyes
in the midst of the darkness, your light woah
it’ll light up a path for me
so we can walk forward without fear, you & i woah
you’re my light you’re my light
at any time
you shine into my heart
you’re my light you’re my light
no matter how far apart we might be
it will always reach me
even if we are apart, it will always reach me",BTS,JPN,1nScVw87kRJiT2bg2Kswhp,292853.0,3TDUktzfYXMWjkWqwoT5F1,0.608,0.644,5.0,-5.588,1.0,0.0314,0.156,0.0,0.124,0.431,99.005,4.0
BTS-274,map of the soul : 7 ~ the journey ~,map of the soul : 7 ~ the journey ~,2020-07-14,12,Your eyes tell,your eyes tell,"why do all these tears just 
keep overflowing like this
hey, stay by my side, 
and laugh

a future without you 
would be a world without colour
monochrome and cold

even the darkness 
you’re gazing into is so beautiful
i want you to put your faith in me
i’m looking straight ahead only at you
so you don’t go anywhere

whatever might await us from now on
i’m looking far ahead, at what lies beyond
this place you have given me, even now
remains my heart’s pillar of support 
the shadows of my past come chasing after me again and again
but the more i tear myself from them
the tighter they hold me in their grasp and follow me
even so, i want to take a hold of it,
wherever i have to go, i’ll find you
i’ll walk the path into tomorrow with you

even if this might turn out to be
the beginning of the end
i’ll call your name

this look in your eyes 
gazing at me is so colorful
i devote my everything to you
it won’t come true, i hold a wish in my heart
while being unable to put it into words

past and future, in order to face them
how much do i have to wish for my hand to reach
it’s that kind of night
thoughts and feelings just keep coming
in this city of dusk*

i want to be loved
and so you can love
i’ll become your eyes
on this journey ahead

even the darkness 
you’re gazing into is so beautiful
i want you to put your faith in me
i’m looking straight ahead only at you 
so you don’t go anywhere

this look in your eyes
watching over me is so colorful
you told me
someday, this sadness will 
keep on spinning our threads together",BTS,JPN,1nScVw87kRJiT2bg2Kswhp,245146.0,3TZ7NHkMT82AhwuYsd00Hz,0.449,0.491,9.0,-6.433,0.0,0.029,0.279,0.0,0.0654,0.258,139.923,4.0

the end of the day
someone come and save me, please
a weary sigh of a tiring day
i guess everyone's happy
can you look at me? 'cause i am blue and grey
the meaning of the tears reflected in the mirror
my color hidden with a smile, blue and grey
i don't know where it went wrong
since my youth, i've had a blue question mark in my head
maybe that's why i've been living so fiercely
but when i look back, i'm all by myself
that hazy shadow that swallows me up
the blue question mark still exists
is it anxiety or depression?
how am i so regretful?
or is it just me, one that loneliness gave birth to
i still don't know, the ferocious blue
i hope i don't erode away, i'll find the exit
i just wanna be happier
to melt the cold me
my hands have reached out countless times
colorless echo
oh, this ground feels so heavier
i am singing by myself
i just wanna be happier
am i being too greedy?
i felt when i walked on the cold winter streets
the sound of my fast heartbeat breathing
i still feel it
don't say it's okay
'cause it's not okay
please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much
on the road i always walk
there is a light that always shines
but today, the scene feels unfamiliar
is it dull or is it broken?
this lump of metal feels heavy
a grey rhino is approaching
i'm just standing there without focus
i don't feel like myself at this moment
i'm just not scared
i don't believe in a god called conviction
words like color make me cringe
a vast grey area is way more comfortable
hundreds of millions of grey facial expressions here
when it rains, it's my world
i dance over this city
on a clear day, bring some fog
on rainy days, we're always together
a toast to all the dust here
i just wanna be happier
please feel the warmth of my hands
they're not warm, so i need you more

i'm ill, yeah, i'm the job itself

how much do you have to earn to be happy?
this hits your head like a glass bottle

everybody's got a lot of diseases, i'm confused by that
that humankind is inherently disgusting
400 more cases of heart disease
there aren't many people that don't work
yo, is it the world or me that's sick?
is it just a difference in interpretation?
i don't know if that's all
i don't know how to change someone
something faster than that is me changing
maybe
it's because i'm sick
because of my many thoughts
i hate that
i'm not so simple
i'm too young, my body's the only grown up
the limp of life
one for the laugh
two for the show
just like i'm so fine

sick and tired
but i don't wanna mess up
'cause life goes on
through the fire
i'll walk more like myself, woah

when night falls, i close my eyes
(walk it, walk it, walk it)
i wanna trust in the day you knew
now wake up one more time
it's morning again, i have to take it today
let's go, one more night
i don't know what's at the end, ayy

i'm stronger
a spark of fire

wh–µn i just looked back
after many seasons
you always h–µre with us together
and every second was forever, oh
